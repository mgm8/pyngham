# Summary

The PyNGHam library is a Python version of the original NGHam protocol library written in C by Jon Petter Skagmo (LA3JPA).

# NGHam Protocol

The NGHam protocol is a link protocol partly inspired by AX.25 [@ax25], with the idea to be used in ham radio packet communication. It was developed in the context of a CubeSat development in the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), and is being used in a few CubeSat missions since then.

A list of known satellites that used or plan to use the NGHam protocol are presented below:

* **FloripaSat-1**
* **GOLDS-UFSC (a.k.a. FloripaSat-2)**
* **Catarina-A1**
* **PION-BR1**
* **Aldebaran-1**
* **NUTS-1**

The top three satellites of the list above, are satellites developed (or in development) by the same research group: the *Space Technology Research Laboratory* (SpaceLab), from *Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina* (Brazil), which was the context where this library was developed.

Figure \ref{fig:ngham-pkt} presents a diagram with the fields of a NGHam packet.

![Fields of a NGHam packet.\label{fig:ngham-pkt}](docs/ngham-pkt.png)

For a GMSK modulation at 9600 bps, a typical preamble sequenc would be 0xAAAAAAAA (a simple alternance of ones and zeros).

The size tag field have seven different options, indicating seven different packet sizes, as described below:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Size Num.   Tag             Reed-Solomon Config.    Max. Data Size
----------  --------------  ---------------------   ------------------------
1           59, 73, 205     RS(47, 31)              up to 28 bytes of data
2           77, 218, 87     RS(79, 63)              up to 60 bytes of data
3           118, 147, 154   RS(111, 95)             up to 92 bytes of data
4           155, 180, 174   RS(159, 127)            up to 124 bytes of data
5           160, 253, 99    RS(191, 159)            up to 156 bytes of data
6           214, 110, 249   RS(223, 191)            up to 188 bytes of data
7           237, 39, 52     RS(255, 223)            up to 220 bytes of data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table:  NGHam packets sizes.

Following the seven possible packet sizes, the next data field is the Reed-Solomon code block, with seven differente schemes, one for each size tag. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ngham-pkt}, the used RS configurations are: (47, 31); (79, 63); (111, 95); (159, 127); (191, 159); (223, 191) and (255, 223).

Inside de code block, there are two types of fields: the packet data and the parity data. The parity data is the byte sequence generated by the Reed-Solomon algorithm. The packet is data is the information of the packet, and is divided in four fields: Header, payload, CRC and padding.

# Python Implementation



# Conclusion

The objective of this library is to offer an alternative purely written Python for the original NGHam library. This way, this can be used in simulations, packet decoding and encoding software, telecommunication classes, and so far.
